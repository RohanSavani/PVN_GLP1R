# PVN_GLP1R
Analysis of fiber photometry data collected and presented in Wang, et al. 2024.
Functions are roughly divided sequentially (i.e., by processing step). Analyses were performed on Linux and MacOS using a miniconda environment that can be installed via [dependencies_macos.yml](dependencies_macos.yml). 

The scripts used to analyze open-field data after processing through DeepLabCut can be found [here](https://github.com/RohanSavani/OpenFieldAnalysis).

Primary analyses were performed in the [Jupyter Notebook](pvnglp1r_finalanalysis.ipynb) file. It is relatively messy but contains the necessary code and timestamps for reproducibility. Feel free to contact with further questions and/or clarifications.
