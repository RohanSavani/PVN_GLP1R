# PVN_GLP1R
Analysis of fiber photometry data collected and presented in Wang, et al. 2024.
Functions are roughly divided sequentially (i.e., by processing step). Analyses were performed on Linux and MacOS using a miniconda environment that can be installed via [dependencies_macos.yml](dependencies_macos.yml). 
The scripts used to analyze open-field data after processing through DeepLabCut can be found [here](https://github.com/RohanSavani/OpenFieldAnalysis).
